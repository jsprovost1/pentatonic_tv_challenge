# Pentatonic Television: Predicting Future TV Buyers

## Introduction

Problem: A fictional electronic company called Pentatonic specialized into selling high-end televisions.

One day, Pentatonic bought a rival company, Meridian, which used to have an important part of the market. Since the merger occurred, we would like to target our new clients with a marketing campaign highlighting our new state-of-the-art television. Currently, we have access to the data of thousand of customers.

The goal of the project is to determine which customers should we target with our new campaign in order the increase our sales.
