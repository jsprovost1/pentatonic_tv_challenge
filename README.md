## Introduction

Problem: A fictional electronic company called Pentatonic specialized into selling high-end televisions.

One day, Pentatonic bought a rival company, Meridian, which used to have an important part of the market.

Currently, we have access to the data of thousand of customers.

The goal of the project is to determine which customers should we target with our new marketing campaign in order the increase our sales.
